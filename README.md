### Haiku

Earth is on fire. Life is suffering. I do not know what to do.

I forced myself to unemployment on January 1st 2021. I want to help.

I would consider freelancing if only I could put my technical knowledge to good
use. Contact me.

**PS**: [An earlier version of this page was less explicit about my ideals. :zipper_mouth_face:](https://xkcd.com/137)
